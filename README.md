# sync_engine_typescript

This example what a rough conversion of a Python script, to help demonstrate in TypeScript, what a more flexible codebase would look like given a slight change with a sync engine.
Once this example was shared the bridge of communication across development teams was greatly supported, this is intended to be working code or a whole solution, but a single rung. 

This was a conversion from a prompted request in ChatGPT. The productivity gained here was the time saved by,
 pooling the resources to punctually define if this was a correct representation of the Python format. 
 To a fleshy friend who did know TypeScript, it became an easier request to make, being: "Does this example express this solution, coherently, in TypeScript". ðŸ¥‚
 Let's save time and the brain cells, for the finer things in life. Check out my other GitHub projects for more fun projects.
